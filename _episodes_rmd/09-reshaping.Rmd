```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("09-")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=7) 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# set ggplot2 theme with bigger text size
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_grey() + theme(text = element_text(size = 16)))
```


In this lesson we're going to learn how to use functions from the `tidyr` package 
(part of `tidyverse`) to help us change the shape of our data to suit our needs.

As usual when starting an analysis on a new script, let's start by loading the 
packages and reading the data. In this case, let's use the clean dataset that we 
created in the last exercise of our 
[previous episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-categorical_variables.md %}).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load the package
library(tidyverse)
# Read the data, specifying how missing values are encoded
gapminder_clean <- read_csv("data/processed/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic_clean.csv", 
                            na = "")
```

If you haven't completed that exercise, here's how you can recreate the clean dataset:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gapminder_clean <- read_csv("data/raw/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic.csv", na = "") %>% 
 # fix typos in main_religion and world region
 mutate(main_religion = str_to_title(str_squish(main_religion)),
        world_region = str_to_title(str_replace_all(world_region, "_", " "))) %>% 
 # fit typos in income groups, which needs more steps
 mutate(income_groups = str_remove(income_groups, "_income")) %>% 
 mutate(income_groups = str_to_title(str_replace_all(income_groups, "_", " "))) %>% 
 # fix/create numeric variables
 mutate(life_expectancy_female = as.numeric(life_expectancy_female),
        life_expectancy_male = ifelse(life_expectancy_male == -999, NA, life_expectancy_male))
```


## Data reshaping

What we mean by "the shape of our data" is how the values are distributed across rows or 
columns. Here's a visual representation of the same data in two different shapes:

![Data Shapes](../fig/07-data_shapes.png)

- "Long" format is where we have a column for each of the types of things we measured 
  or recorded in our data. In other words, each _variable_ has its own column.
- "Wide" format occurs when we have data relating to the same measured thing in 
  different columns. In this case, we have values related to our "metric" spread 
  across multiple columns (a column each for a year). 
  
Neither of these formats is necessarily more correct than the other: it will depend 
on what analysis you intend on doing. 
However, it is worth mentioning that the "long" format is often preferred, as it 
is clearer how many distinct types of variables we have in the data. 

To figure out which format you might need, it may help to think of which visualisations 
you may want to build with `ggplot2`. Taking the above example:

- If one was interested in looking at the change of the "metric" across years for each country,
  then the long format is more suitable to define each _aesthetic_ of such a graph: 
  `aes(x = year, y = metric, colour = country)`.
- If one was interested in the _correlation_ of this metric between 1960 and 2010, then the 
  wide format would be more suitable: `aes(x = yr1960, y = yr2010, colour = country)`.


### Using the `pivot` functions

Let's look at how we can reshape our data in practice. There are two functions in the 
`tidyr` package (part of `tidyverse`) that can help us with this:

- `pivot_wider()`: from _long_ to _wide_ format.
- `pivot_longer()`: from _wide_ to _long_ format.

Here is the same picture with added code: 

![pivot](../fig/07-tidyr_pivot.png)

Let's say we'd like to look at the correlation of `income_per_person` between 1960 and 
2010 across all the countries in our dataset. 
To achieve this, we will need to create a "wide" version of our table, where each row 
is a country and each column a year, with values of `income_per_person` in each cell 
of the table.

```{r}
income_wide <- gapminder_clean %>% 
  # select only the columns we're interested in
  select(country, year, income_per_person) %>% 
  # use pivot_wider to go from long to wide format
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", 
              names_prefix = "yr",
              values_from = "income_per_person")
income_wide
```

Note that the `names_prefix` argument is optional. Here, we've used it because it's a
good idea to avoid column names that start with a number. In other cases you can omit it.

Now, we could answer our question of interest:

```{r}
income_wide %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yr1960, yr2010)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")
```

The oposite of this operation can be achieved with the `pivot_longer()` function. 
Let's reverse the reshaping we did above:

```{r}
income_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = yr1960:yr2010,
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "income_per_person")
```

Note that the `cols` argument of `pivot_longer()` accepts column specifications in a 
similar way to the `select()` function discussed in an earlier episode. For example, 
in this case we could have also used `contains("yr")` to use all the columns containing 
the string "yr".
