teaching: 50
exercises: 30
questions:

objectives: 
- "use of the `dplyr` package to manipulate tabular data (add or modify variables, select and rename columns)"
- "understand and use 'pipes' as a way to build a chain of operations on data"
- "discuss some common issues with data cleaning and use functions from the `stringr` package to help solve them"
- "discuss how to deal with missing data"
keypoints:

cover:

- data manipulation with `dplyr`: `select()` + `:` + `matches()`, `rename()`, `mutate()`
  - `matches("_male")`
- pipes `%>%`
- Exercise: create column with total population
- factors to improve visualisation: `fct_reorder()` for example?
- more missing data
  - `drop_na()`: how to remove missing data (and when should we do it?)
  - visualise missing data (special `naniar` geometries?) - data not missing at random!
- cleaning up things (or should this go on the next lesson?): `stringr`, `na_if()`
  - `na_if(employment_rate_male, "-")`
  - `na_if(employment_rate_female, "-")`
  - `str_to_lower(main_religion)`
  - `str_trim(main_religion)`
